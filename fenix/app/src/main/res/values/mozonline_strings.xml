No privacy information is required to use the basic functions.

We will enable these permissions after obtaining your consent through a separate pop-up when you use the corresponding functions. You can also close the permissions at any time through device settings. If you disagree with enabling permissions, it will not affect the normal use of other unrelated functions.
